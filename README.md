# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history, leading to significant loss of life. Over 1,500 passengers and crew perished that fateful night. Understanding the factors that contributed to survival can provide valuable insights into safety protocols and social dynamics during crises. In this project, we will leverage machine learning techniques to predict the survival chances of Titanic passengers based on various features, such as sex, age, and passenger class. Using the Random Forest classification algorithm, we aim to build a predictive model that will allow us to estimate the likelihood of survival for each individual aboard the Titanic.
There will be three main steps in this experiment:

1)Feature Engineering
2)Imputation
3)Training and Prediction
